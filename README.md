# [Classification of Plant Cell Images using CNN](https://danhealey.github.io/analyzing-leaf-morphology/README.pdf)

We created a model to classify images of plant cells based on image quality. Our approach
was to use a convolutional neural network. This network
was trained on a dataset containing good quality cell images
and their respective artificially degraded counterparts. The
quality of images in the training and testing dataset was
labeled by project participants on a subjective basis. The
convolutional neural network preformed well on the training
set of good and poor quality images.
